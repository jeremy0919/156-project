This was a group project between me and one other collaborater to create a Tic-tac-toe game that uses socket programming

How to run
- boot up Server.py, server should return current Ip address
- go to client.py and modify line 102 to equal the current Ip address returned or leave as host if running all files on one machine
    -note: ensure port is free as well 
- Then run one or two client.py for either one or two players

Improvements
- Ui
- Error handling: well you would have to try and there is error checking there are ways to break it
